# DuncanCraft OpenTK

This is a voxel project I am making in C# using OpenTK. Right now, you can break and place blocks, but that's really it. The player can also move around and jump.
This is one of my first OpenGL projects so it is not optimized at all, expect bugs.

## Controls

* WASD - Move around
* Left Click - Break blocks
* Right Click - Place blocks
* Esc - Exit the game
* N - Toggle wireframes.

## How to Use

Download the project and open it in Visual Studio. It should get all the dependencies but if not it uses OpenTK, StbImageSharp, and System.Drawing
